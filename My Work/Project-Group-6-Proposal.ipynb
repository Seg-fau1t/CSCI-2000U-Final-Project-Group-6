    "## Getting The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "This data relates to the RentSafeTO program in Toronto, it contains evaluations of apartment buildings with three or more storeys or 10 or more units. Each evaluation (conducted by an inspector) ranks various aspects of the complex, mechanical and security systems, parking and exterior grounds, ect. They are ranked from 1-5 with five being the best score. This score helps determine the building's condition and this information is then used to help decision making about the complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "an overview of the data as well as where it was gotten from, is available at https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/apartment-building-evaluation/. The downloaded copy is also in the same dir as the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Due to the data being updated daily, it is important to know this copy was created on October ‎22, ‎2021, ‏‎17:53:55\n"
